Write a JavaScript program to highlight the bold words of the following paragraph by changing the text color to red, on mouse over. 

We have just started this section for the users (beginner to intermediate) who want to work with various JavaScript problems and write 
scripts online to test their JavaScript skill.   


Hint: wordItems = document.getElementsByTagName('strong'); // The paragraph uses <strong></strong> tags for the bold words. 
Change <strong> default behavior.
